# Calliope: The AI Dev Platform for Builders

## 👋 χαῖρε / hola / hello  
**Calliope.ai** is an all-in-one development platform for building, testing, and shipping AI applications with zero hassle and complete control.

Built on open tooling. Powered by commercial and open models. Secured by design.  
Whether you're running RAG pipelines, hosting custom LLMs, or just tinkering in notebooks, Calliope gives you the tools, agents, and infrastructure to build securely and move fast.

## ✨ What is Calliope?

Calliope is a secure, modular AI workbench that turns notebooks into production-grade power tools. Everything you need to go from exploration to deployment — without giving up control.

- 🧠 **In-Notebook AI Assistants**: Code suggestions, data exploration, refactors, and reviews — right where you work.
- 💬 **Agent Framework**: Build AI agents that talk to your notebooks, databases, APIs, and systems.
- 🧪 **Prompt & RAG Toolkit**: Design, test, and evaluate prompts and chains with real data in reproducible workflows.
- 🛰 **Secure Model Hosting**: Host your models or bring your own. Run in our cloud or yours — fully isolated.
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Ephemeral secrets, encrypted data, signed builds, microsegmented infra, and CI-native from day zero.
- 🔌 **Plays Nice With Everything**: AWS, GCP, HuggingFace, LangChain, OpenAI, Postgres, Pinecone, GitHub, and more.
- 🚀 **Zero Lock-In**: Open formats, open standards, and standard notebooks — no proprietary traps.

## 🧰 Who It’s For

Calliope is built for:
- Developers building AI-powered apps and pipelines  
- Data scientists tired of copy-paste workflows and brittle stacks  
- Educators and learners who need safe, collaborative compute  
- Startups building internal copilots or launching novel AI interfaces  
- Enterprises that need governed, auditable, and secure AI environments

If you're using other vibey devtools, Calliope gives you **more power, more control, and no strings attached**.

## 🔐 Security, By Default

Privacy, integrity, and auditability aren’t features — they’re defaults.
- Microsegmented tenants with namespaced isolation  
- Encrypted at rest and in transit  
- Ephemeral secrets and API tokens  
- CI-controlled build and deployment pipelines  
- Signed commits, tracked builds, full code provenance  
- SOC 2, HIPAA, and enterprise compliance underway

## 💡 Why Open Source?

Because open wins.  
Calliope is built on open tooling and designed to be forked, extended, self-hosted, and remixed — for teams, orgs, or individuals. Build on it. Break it. Make it yours.
