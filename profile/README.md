# Calliope: The AI Dev Platform for Builders

## 👋 χαῖρε / hola / hello  
Welcome to **Calliope.ai** — your all-in-one development playground for building, testing, and shipping AI applications with zero hassle and complete control.

Built on JupyterLab. Powered by open models. Secured by design.  
Whether you're running RAG pipelines, hosting custom LLMs, or just tinkering in notebooks, Calliope gives you the tools, agents, and infrastructure to build securely and move fast.

## ✨ What is Calliope?

Calliope is a secure, modular AI workbench that turns notebooks into superpowers. It’s everything you need to go from exploration to production — without giving up control.

- 🧠 **In-notebook AI Assistants**: Natural language code suggestions, dataset queries, refactors, reviews — all inside JupyterLab.
- 💬 **Agent Framework**: Custom agents that can talk to databases, notebooks, APIs, and your internal data.
- 🧪 **Prompt Engineering & RAG Tools**: Build, test, and deploy prompts, chains, and apps from notebooks or UI.
- 🛰 **Secure Model Hosting**: Bring your models or use ours. Calliope runs in your cloud (or ours) with full isolation.
- 🔒 **Built for Privacy**: Ephemeral secrets, encrypted storage, signed builds, microsegmented tenants. CI from day zero.
- 🔌 **Integrates Anywhere**: AWS, GCP, HuggingFace, LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, Postgres, Pinecone, GitHub, and more.
- 🚀 **Zero Lock-In**: Everything runs in standard notebooks and open formats — not some closed IDE.

## 🧰 Who It's For

Calliope is for:
- Developers building AI-powered apps or pipelines  
- Data scientists are tired of switching tools to get things working  
- Students and educators who want safe, collaborative computing  
- Startups building internal copilots or launching agentic interfaces  
- Enterprises that need governed, auditable AI environments

If you're using other swanky vibecoding tools, Calliope gives you **more power, more control, and no strings attached**.

## 🔐 Security, By Default

From day one, everything in Calliope has been designed with privacy and integrity in mind:
- Microsegmented tenants with namespaced isolation  
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit  
- Ephemeral secrets and token access  
- Fully CI-managed infrastructure and deployments  
- Signed commits and build provenance  
- Ready for SOC 2, HIPAA, and enterprise compliance

## 💡 Why Open Source?

Because open wins.  
The future of AI development should be fast, flexible, and inspectable. Calliope is built to be extended, self-hosted, and modified — whether you're running it for yourself or your team.

Use our platform, fork it, contribute back, or build something completely new on top.
